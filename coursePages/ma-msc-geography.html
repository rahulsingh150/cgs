        <h2>CHOICE BASED CREDIT SYSTEM (CBCS)</h2>
        <p>
          (The ordinance and the regulation of M.A./M.Sc. is adopted from common
          ordinance of Universities of Bihar from the Governor's secretariat,
          Bihar via Memo No. Estb. PREAMBLE: 40/2017-1457/GS(I), Dated-
          29-05-2018)
        </p>
        <p>
          The CBCS provides an opportunity for the students to choose courses
          from the prescribed list of courses comprising core, elective and
          ability enhancement courses. The courses can be evaluated following
          the grading system, which is considered to be better than the
          conventional marks system. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce
          uniform grading system in the entire higher education in India. This
          will benefit the students of universities of Bihar to move across
          institutions within India to begin with and across countries. The
          uniform grading system will also enable potential employers in
          assessing the performance of the candidates. The Universities shall
          follow the guidelines formulated by the UGC in order to bring
          uniformity in evaluation system and computation of the Cumulative
          Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on student's performance in
          examinations.
