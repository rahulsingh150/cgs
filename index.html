          REPORT OF 5 DAYS EARLY CAREER WORKSHOP ON GEOSPATIAL ANALYTICS AND
          URBAN PLANNING
        </p>
        <p>
          Five days International Workshop (17.05.2022 -21.05.2022) was launched
          in collaboration with Wolverhampton University, Urban Studies
          Foundation, United Kingdom on 17.05.2022 at Centre for Geographical
          Studies, Aryabhatta Knowledge University, Patna. The title of this
          international workshop is "Geospatial Analysis and Urban Planning".
          Hon’ble Minister, Shri Sumit Kumar Singh, Science and Technology
          Department, Govt. of Bihar, Patna was present as a Chief Guest in the
          Inaugural Session of the workshop. Shri Deepak Kumar Singh, Additional
          Chief Secretary, Education Department, Government of Bihar, Shri Rash
          Bihari Prasad Singh, Former Vice Chancellor, Patna University and
          Komali Yenneti, Wolverhampton University, United Kingdom were present
          as special guests. Key Note Speaker was from National Institute of
          Urban Affairs, New Delhi, Professor Debolina Kundu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Kundu presented her Key Note Lecture titled – “Covid19 and
          Indian Cities”. She said that there was a reduction in the level of
          consumption due to the effect of Covid-19. Problems like lack of
          income, shortage of food grains etc. have been noticed. She talked
          about the need to take various steps at the policy and implementation
          level and focused on people living in poverty. Prof. Kundu pointed out
          the emergence of new poor which can become a big problem if properly
          not taken care of. Thus, she emphasized on the need of real time
          tracking building, housing and the infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Debolina also mentioned the United Nation's Moto - “Leaving no
          one behind". Dr. Komali Yenneti, from Wolverhampton University
          followed her. In her lecture on the study of urban heat island and its
          hotspots presented her views in the context of the construction of
          Dashboard by Covid, urban planning, and capacity building plans
          through 3D modeling. After this, Prof. Rash Bihari Prasad Singh,
          former Vice Chancellor, Patna University said that our country and the
          state of Bihar need new technology-based skilled people in huge
          quantity who can do the work of urban Centre, urban planning through
          GIS and remote sensing. For this, he told that at present the rate of
          urbanization in Bihar is very low. Many problems are emerging due to
          new urban planning in small towns of Bihar like Muzaffarpur,
          Bhagalpur, Gaya etc. In such a situation, the result or report of this
          workshop can be used by the government for planning so that the
          society can get maximum benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shri Deepak Kumar Singh, Additional Chief Secretary, Education
          Department, Government of Bihar also expressed his views in this
          regard. He told on the basis of observation that Urban Heat Island is
          becoming a widespread problem. At present, the temperature of a
          metropolis like Delhi has gone up to 46 °C in Patna. The main reasons
          for this are the structures made of concrete, bitumen and glass. All
          these factors are responsible for the rise in temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing attention to the drainage system of the cities, he stressed on
          the need to locate the water bodies around the cities and also told
          that it is not practical to completely abolish the old drainage
          systems. Its conservation and promotion need attention. Hon'ble
          Minister Shri Sumit Kumar Singh, the chief guest of this program,
          extended his best wishes for the successful organization of this
          international workshop. He said that the Geographical Studies Centre
          was established with the thinking of the Honourable Chief Minister
          Shri Nitish Kumar, which seems to be fruitful. He said that whatever
          results come from this workshop, there is a need to reach it to the
          general public so that everyone can benefit from it. The second day of
          the International Workshop was successfully completed on 18-05-2022.
          In the second day's workshop, firstly Atul Saini of Delhi University
          presented his lecture on the topic - “Climate Change in Cities and
          Modeling”. He observed that there is a rapid change in temperature.
          Presenting his research with the help of various models, he said that
          at present the temperature rise in Leh and Ladakh region is an unusual
          and untimely phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also described the characteristics of various sensors of the
          satellite and gave a detailed description of different types of
          climatic maps.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, Prof. Komali Yenneti of Wolverhampton University presented
          her lecture on the urban heat island. In her lecture, she discussed
          various reasons responsible for the increase in temperature in cities,
          she also talked as to how the temperature can be reduced with the help
          of various parameters which was presented as a model through example
          maps of many cities of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the practical class was conducted by N. N. Salghuna of Madras
          University. She apprised the students present in the workshop about
          the various techniques of making Landsat map.

          With the help of these software, the data was linked from the PHC
          level to the National level New Delhi. From sample collection of Covid
          19 to its identification and sending it to the laboratory, work used
          to be done with the help of GIS. Along with this, information was
          given to the investigator through SMS and it was continued all through
          the inspection process till the patient become healthy. He also told
          that the help of this type of portal was taken to ensure the
          availability of oxygen cylinders along with ensuring the beds in the
          state hospitals through various portals.

          In the Hands-on session, N.N Salghuna who is head and proprietor,
          member of Active Spatial Science Research Group, told us about a new
          app called tableau from which Dashboard can be created. During this
          learning session, any data, description can be represented by
          statistical details like construction of map, bar diagram etc.
          Finally, in the workshop by Naga Venkata Sai Kumar Manapragada,
          Assistant Professor, Manipal University, talked about new software
          like Python, Anaconda and Spider and explained the importance in the

          The fourth day was successfully completed on 20.05.2022. The
          International Workshop of the Fourth Day began with a lecture by Dr.
          Anil Kumar Roy, Associate Professor, Faculty of Learning, CEPT
          University, Ahmedabad. The title of his lecture was "Knowledge, Skill
          and Employability of Planning Profession". In his lecture, Dr. Roy,
          firstly described the history related to the planning from the very
          beginning till the date. He also talked about the planning in
          different regions like Europe, Africa, Asia, India etc. Accordingly,
          there has been a change in its form. In India, the planning first
          started in 1955 and till now the various dimensions of the planning
          has been developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He observed that the educational planning is going through various
          types of changes. In the past, planning was used for
          industrialization, urbanization and modernization but now there is a
          paradigm shift towards multi-disciplinary approach, which includes
          civil engineering, geography, economics, social science, political
          science, architecture, law, information technology, etc. Through this
          the approach of holistic planning can be realized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Roy stressed that the land use plannings are done under three main
          categories, namely, physical or spatial planning, socio-economic
          planning and design planning. He emphasized the need for collaborative
          research analysis in the field of planning, which is not being used at
          a bigger scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Roy also talked about the need for gender planning in the
          present-day context and also to keep in mind the climate change for
          the future of planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present there are a total of 4500 planners in the country but by
          2030, the country will need about three lakh planners as said by Dr.
          Anil Roy. Finally, while discussing the problems related to planning
          in the urban area at present, he said that planning can be
          successfully done with new technology but community participation is
          must. He explained the various methods of operating the Rhino
          Grasshopper tools while creating the Urban Geospatial strata for
          Sustainable cities and communities. He told that with the help of this
          tool, urban modelling and analysis, study of urban heat island, study
          of urban heat island and wind speed can be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that Naga Venkata Sai Kumar Manapragada, Assistant Professor,
          Manipal University explained the various methods of operating the
          Rhino Grasshopper tools while discussing the Urban Geospatial strata
